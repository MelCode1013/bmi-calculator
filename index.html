    <p>Better understand your weight in relation to your height using our
      body mass index (BM) calculator. While BMI is not the sole determinant
      of a healthy weight, it offers a valuable starting point to evaluate
      your overall health and well-being.</p>

    <h2>What your BMI result means</h2>

    <p>A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
      healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
      such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
      fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
      strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
      five days a week.</p>

    <h2>Limitations of BMI</h2>

    <p>
      Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
      every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
      certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.
    </p>

    <div>
      <img src="./assets/images/icon-gender.svg" alt="gender icon">
      <h3>Gender</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
      a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.
    </p>

    <div>
      <img src="./assets/images/icon-age.svg" alt="birthday cake icon representing age">
      <h3>Age</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
      body fat content.
    </p>

    <div>
      <img src="./assets/images/icon-muscle.svg" alt="arm flexing muscle icon">
      <h3>Muscle</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
      differentiate muscle from fat.
    </p>

    <div>
      <img src="./assets/images/icon-pregnancy.svg" alt="baby icon representing pregnancy">
      <h3>Pregnancy</h3>
    </div>
    <p>
      Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a
      healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother
      and child.
    </p>

    <div>

      <h3>Race</h3>

    <p>
      Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
      lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your
      GP or practice nurse.
